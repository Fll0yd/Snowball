If You Build a Dedicated PC for Snowball

If you’re building a separate PC specifically to house Snowball, you can focus entirely on the AI's needs. Here’s a recommended build for that:

CPU:
AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12-core) or Intel Core i9-12900K (16-core)
These CPUs will provide the necessary cores and threads for handling multitasking (AI tasks, background processes, etc.) and machine learning workloads.

GPU:
NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti or NVIDIA RTX 3090 (for heavier ML tasks)
For machine learning models, gaming simulations, and any AI tasks involving deep learning, these GPUs will provide excellent performance for training and inference.

RAM:
64 GB DDR4 at 3200MHz or higher
This ensures you have plenty of memory to run multiple processes in parallel without slowing down your system.

Storage:
2 TB NVMe SSD for system operations and quick access to large datasets.
4 TB HDD for long-term storage of logs, datasets, and model files.

Cooling:
Liquid Cooling System (for the CPU and possibly the GPU)
AI workloads can be resource-intensive, generating significant heat over time. A good cooling system will keep the hardware running efficiently without throttling.

Power Supply (PSU):
750W to 850W 80+ Gold Certified PSU
You’ll need a powerful and reliable PSU to ensure stable energy supply, especially for a build with a high-end CPU and GPU.
