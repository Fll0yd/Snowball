1. Extend Mobile Integration (mobile_integration.py)
A. Add Facebook Messenger & Google Maps Support
Facebook Messenger API: Integrate with the Facebook Messenger API to allow Snowball AI to analyze conversations or even respond automatically. You can use the Facebook Graph API for this.
Google Maps API: Deepen the integration so Snowball can track location-based tasks. Using the Google Maps API will allow Snowball to analyze your location and send reminders or perform actions (like detecting when you're near a specific location).
B. Expand Command Capabilities
Create a robust command parser that recognizes voice/text input to trigger PC-level actions. Focus on natural language commands like, "Download [movie]," "Move file to [folder]," or "Open application."
python
Copy code
def handle_mobile_request(request):
    if "download" in request.lower():
        # Trigger download process
        movie_name = extract_movie_name(request)
        return f"Downloading {movie_name}."
    elif "move file" in request.lower():
        # Trigger file movement
        return "Moving the file to Plex directory."
    # Add more commands based on your needs
2. Automating Movie Downloads
Web Scraping with Requests and BeautifulSoup: Use web scraping to automate the process of going to piratebay.com, searching for the movie, and fetching the magnet link.
Automating Torrent Client (qBittorrent): After obtaining the magnet link, you can control qBittorrent (or any other torrent client) using its Web API. For qBittorrent, you can use qBittorrent Web API.
Here's a simple script to add a torrent via qBittorrent:

python
Copy code
import requests

def download_movie(magnet_link):
    url = 'http://localhost:8080/api/v2/torrents/add'
    headers = {
        'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    }
    data = {'urls': magnet_link}
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, auth=('admin', 'password'))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return "Download started successfully."
    else:
        return "Failed to add torrent."

3. Automating File Movement to Plex Directory
OS File Handling: After the download completes, Snowball should automatically move the file from your downloads folder to the Plex Movies folder. You can use Python's os and shutil libraries to move files.
Example:
python
Copy code
import shutil
import os

def move_movie_to_plex(download_path, plex_path):
    try:
        files = [f for f in os.listdir(download_path) if f.endswith(('.mp4', '.mkv'))]
        for file in files:
            shutil.move(os.path.join(download_path, file), os.path.join(plex_path, file))
        return "File moved to Plex."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to move file: {str(e)}"
4. Casting to TV from Phone
Chromecast API: To cast the movie to your TV, integrate with Chromecast or other casting protocols. You can use pychromecast to automate this.
Example:

python
Copy code
import pychromecast

def cast_to_tv(file_path):
    chromecasts, _ = pychromecast.get_chromecasts()
    cast = next(cc for cc in chromecasts if cc.device.friendly_name == "Living Room TV")
    cast.wait()
    media_controller = cast.media_controller
    media_controller.play_media(file_path, 'video/mp4')
    media_controller.block_until_active()
    return "Casting started."
5. Voice Command Handling
Text to Command Mapping: You need a natural language processing (NLP) layer to map spoken commands to actions. The NLPEngine youâ€™ve set up in nlp_engine.py can be extended to handle these tasks.
Example:

python
Copy code
def process_mobile_command(command):
    if "pirate the new" in command:
        movie = extract_movie_name(command)
        magnet_link = fetch_magnet_link(movie)  # Use your web scraping logic here
        download_movie(magnet_link)
        move_movie_to_plex('/Downloads', '/Plex/Movies')
        cast_to_tv('/Plex/Movies/' + movie)
        return "Movie download, transfer, and casting initiated."
6. Real-Time Sync & Notification
Mobile Alerts: Ensure you get mobile notifications (via Pushbullet or Firebase) once the movie is downloaded or when the system encounters errors.
Add a notification system to inform you when Snowball completes tasks, like finishing a download or moving files.
