Fitbit Sense 2

Key Features:
Advanced sleep tracking, including sleep score, REM, light, and deep sleep cycles.
Stress management with electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors.
Continuous heart rate monitoring and SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking.
Fitbit's ecosystem is compatible with Google Health and can integrate data through its API.

AI Integration:
Fitbit provides detailed health data that Snowball could use to suggest changes to your routine, such as optimizing your sleep cycle or suggesting specific workouts to improve overall fitness.
It could alert you if your stress levels are consistently high and recommend breathing exercises or mindfulness practices, based on its analysis of your EDA.

Integration with Snowball AI
To integrate any of these wearables with Snowball, you will need to:

Access Health Data via APIs: Most wearable manufacturers offer APIs for accessing user health data (such as Apple HealthKit, Google Health, and Fitbit API). Youâ€™ll want to authenticate with these APIs and pull in sleep, heart rate, activity, and stress data.

Process Data in Real-Time: Snowball could use this data to make daily recommendations regarding your sleep, exercise, and stress management. For example:

Sleep Optimization: Analyze your sleep cycles and suggest adjustments to your bedtime routine.

Stress Management: Use heart rate variability or EDA sensors to monitor stress and suggest relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises.

Nutrition: The AI could track your daily activity and caloric burn and suggest meal plans or hydration reminders accordingly.
