Roadmap for Developing Snowball AI
Below is a structured roadmap, listing each feature in order of priority. The approach is designed to ensure you build Snowball AI in logical steps, starting with the core framework and essential features before progressing to more complex and advanced functionalities.

Phase 1: Core AI Foundation
This phase focuses on building the foundation for the AI, including core functionality like memory management, voice interaction, and decision-making.

1. Memory and Data Storage (High Priority)
Task: Implement the memory.py module and set up the SQLite database for storing interactions, chat history, and the AI's learning process.
How:
Build the Memory class in memory.py.
Set up SQLite to store conversations and track user interactions. This includes methods to save, retrieve, and manage the AI's memory of past conversations.
Ensure chat history and user-specific data are stored and categorized (e.g., per project).
Outcome: A functioning memory system that will serve as the backbone for Snowball’s learning and interaction tracking.

*Optional Enhancements*:

Encryption: If you plan to store sensitive information, consider encrypting the database to enhance security.
Backup System: Add an automatic backup mechanism for your SQLite database to prevent data loss in case of crashes or corruption.


2. Voice Interface (High Priority)
Task: Implement the voice_interface.py module for handling voice input and output.
How:
Use Google Speech Recognition for voice input and gTTS for text-to-speech output.
Ensure that Snowball can listen to user input, process the text, and respond via voice.
Outcome: Snowball will be able to communicate with you verbally and respond using natural language.


3. Basic Decision Making (High Priority)
Task: Implement basic decision-making logic in decision_maker.py.
How:
Create a class to handle requests like setting reminders, answering questions, and initiating different modules (e.g., games, system monitoring).
Outcome: Snowball will be able to make decisions based on user input and respond with appropriate actions.
Phase 2: System Monitoring and Logs
Once the core is set, Snowball should be able to monitor your PC’s system health. This phase involves adding system monitoring capabilities and implementing log management.


4. System Monitoring (Medium Priority)
Task: Implement the system_monitor.py module to monitor CPU, memory, and temperature.
How:
Use the psutil library to monitor system health.
Set up thresholds (e.g., CPU > 85%) that trigger notifications via desktop alerts.
Outcome: Snowball will notify you when your system is under heavy load or close to overheating, ensuring your PC runs smoothly.


5. Logging (Medium Priority)
Task: Implement logging functionality for interactions and errors in the logs/ directory.
How:
Create a system that logs all interactions and system-related errors in the respective log files.
Ensure each log entry is timestamped and contains sufficient detail for debugging.
Outcome: Logs will be maintained for tracking interactions and system issues, which will help with troubleshooting and monitoring.
Phase 3: Game AI and Reinforcement Learning
Now that the foundation is set, Snowball can start to become more interactive and intelligent by playing games and learning over time.

*Optional Enhancements*:

1a. Persistent Logging: Store system metrics in log files (or a database) for long-term analysis. You could create daily or weekly reports.

1b. Threshold-based Alerts: Set up a notification system that alerts you when any of the metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, temperature, etc.) exceed specific thresholds for a sustained period. You could send these alerts as desktop notifications, emails, or even push notifications to your phone.

2. Resource Optimization Suggestions:
Optimization Suggestions: Based on the system monitor's data (e.g., high disk usage or memory usage), you can suggest actions like cleaning up unused files, stopping heavy processes, or upgrading hardware.

3. Remote Monitoring:
Remote Access: If you'd like to monitor multiple systems, you could implement a remote monitoring feature using APIs like Flask or FastAPI to collect and send system metrics from different machines to a central server or dashboard.

4. More Detailed GPU Monitoring:
GPU Process Monitoring: Track which processes are using the GPU the most. This could be particularly useful if you're working on deep learning projects or gaming.

5. Process Management:
Process Management Tools: Add functionality to allow the user to kill, prioritize, or pause processes directly from the tray icon or through a command-line interface.

6. Custom Widgets for Desktop:
You could create simple desktop widgets (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) that display real-time system stats without needing to open the full application.

6. Reinforcement Learning for Games (Medium Priority)
Task: Implement reinforcement.py to allow Snowball to play games using reinforcement learning techniques.
How:
Start by implementing a Q-learning algorithm to teach Snowball how to play simple games like Snake.
Use Keras to build and train the reinforcement learning model.
Outcome: Snowball will be able to learn from past actions and improve its gameplay over time, becoming a smarter opponent.


7. Game AI (Medium Priority)
Task: Implement basic game-playing logic in games/ (e.g., Snake, Risk, Pool).
How:
Create game-specific AI logic in files like pool.py, AIRISK.py, and snake_game.py.
Integrate these games into the main AI so that Snowball can play them when requested.
Outcome: Snowball will be able to play a variety of games with you and gradually improve at them.
Phase 4: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Decision-Making Refinement
Once Snowball is able to communicate and play games, you can focus on refining how it understands and processes natural language.


8. Natural Language Processing (NLP) (High Priority)
Task: Implement the nlp_engine.py module using spaCy or transformers.
How:
Load a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., spaCy's en_core_web_sm) for basic natural language understanding.
Add functionality to extract intents and entities from user input.
Outcome: Snowball will be able to understand more complex inputs and extract specific intents (e.g., "set a reminder", "play a game").


9. Advanced Decision Making (Medium Priority)
Task: Refine the decision-making logic in decision_maker.py to incorporate NLP insights.
How:
Integrate the NLP engine so that Snowball can handle more complex requests (e.g., setting reminders, answering questions based on memory).
Outcome: Snowball will be able to interpret user input in a more sophisticated way, providing context-aware responses.
Phase 5: Mobile Integration and Cloud Sync
At this stage, Snowball can begin integrating with your mobile devices and cloud services to enhance its usefulness in your day-to-day life.

10. Mobile Integration (Low Priority)
Task: Implement mobile integration in mobile_integration.py to sync with Google Maps and Facebook Messenger.
How:
Use APIs from Google and Facebook to pull data like GPS locations and messages.
Set up functionality to track routines (e.g., picking up your kids) and process messages from Messenger.
Outcome: Snowball will become aware of your daily routines and adapt to changes based on mobile data.
11. Cloud Sync (Low Priority)
Task: Implement cloud sync in cloud_sync/ to allow Snowball to share data across devices (e.g., mobile, PC).
How:
Use cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox) to store and sync chat history and memory across devices.
Ensure seamless communication between the mobile and PC versions of Snowball.
Outcome: Snowball will have access to your information across multiple platforms, allowing for a more cohesive AI experience.
Phase 6: Sensor and InMoov Integration
After all core functionality is established, you can integrate Snowball with physical devices like the InMoov robot.

12. Sensor Integration (Low Priority)
Task: Implement sensor data collection in sensors.py.
How:
Interface with hardware sensors to collect data such as temperature, motion, and proximity.
Set up the sensor integration to be adaptable for future expansion (e.g., controlling motors for the InMoov robot).
Outcome: Snowball will start interacting with the physical world, collecting sensor data and acting on it.
13. InMoov Robot Integration (Low Priority)
Task: Set up inmoov/ directory to control and interact with the InMoov robot.

Set up automated tasks that clear old logs, reset memory if needed, and maintain a stable environment.
Outcome: Snowball will remain functional and responsive over time, without performance degradation.
15. Expansion and New Features (Ongoing Priority)
Task: Continuously improve and add features to Snowball based on feedback and new technologies.
