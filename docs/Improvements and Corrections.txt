Improvements and Corrections


4. Game AI Performance:

You are using Q-learning for Snake AI, which works but could be slow to converge on large grids (e.g., 30x30). You could switch to deep Q-learning (DQN) with a neural network for higher-dimensional state spaces, which would be more efficient in larger or more complex environments.

5. Security for Sensitive Data:

Make sure you are encrypting sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user data, and memory storage). This will prevent sensitive information from being exposed if the project scales up or is hosted externally.

6. Enhance Logging Levels:

Your current logger implementation is solid, but you might want to split log levels more carefully across different system components (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) so that you can trace issues more easily.
Short-Term Actionable Tasks
Implement SSL for WebSocket Communication for improved security on the mobile side.
Start testing basic InMoov commands for physical integration.
Extend the system monitoring GUI with real-time feedback for CPU, memory, and temperature stats.
Refactor the file structure, splitting configuration and model files by function and creating specific directories for each component.
Your Snowball AI project is already quite advanced, so focusing on refining the architecture, improving UX, and expanding functionality will make it even more powerful and scalable!
