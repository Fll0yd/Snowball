Project Overview: Snowball AI
Concept and Vision
Snowball AI is designed to be a singular, evolving artificial intelligence that integrates seamlessly into everyday life. The AI acts as a personal assistant and pet, living on your computer and mobile devices while continuously learning and growing from your interactions. It will play a series of games, starting with Snake and expanding to Pool, Pac-Man, and Asteroids, using the same AI entity for all. This allows for a consistent learning experience, where the AI develops skills and memory as it interacts with different environments.

Inspired by the podcast "Dudsey," where Will Sasso's AI interacts based on his social media and preferences, Snowball AI will similarly have continuous access to your data and feed across all your applications and social networks. This project aims to create an AI capable of self-awareness, name recognition, and personal decision-making, making it more interactive and tailored to your lifestyle.

Core Features
Unified AI Entity: Unlike traditional AIs that specialize in separate tasks (like facial recognition or sentiment analysis), Snowball AI will remember and grow from every interaction and task it undertakes.

Continuous Learning: The AI will always be running in the background, absorbing information from your voice commands and interactions, updating its knowledge base without needing manual inputs. This enables it to serve reminders and assist you based on real-life conversations.

Voice Interaction: Implementing voice recognition and speech synthesis will allow the AI to communicate naturally, making it feel more like a companion.

Game Integration: The AI will be incorporated into various games, learning and adapting as it plays, reinforcing its capabilities through experience.

System Monitoring: Snowball AI will monitor your computer's performance, alerting you of any issues such as overheating or hardware malfunctions.

Automated Data Access: The AI will continuously gather data from applications like Spotify, YouTube, and social media, automating the updating process for your preferences and routines.

Home Integration: The AI will also be integrated into your mobile device, listening to important conversations, like reminders from your wife, and ensuring that tasks are completed as requested.

Duck on the Desk: This AI will function as a "duck on the desk," allowing you to explain your projects and code to it, effectively helping you learn and refine your programming skills.

File Structure
The project will utilize a modular file structure to maintain organization and facilitate development:

This project aims to enhance productivity, learning, and user experience through intelligent design and continuous improvement.




I was wanting to make a series of games played by AI I started with snake and next is a pool game but also had pacman and asteroids in mind, but I wondered  what if I had the same AI play each game and continue to grow and learn and evolve as a singular AI entity as it plays each game?

The AI could be its own code script that is then imported into each game

The idea for this AI would be almost like a pet/assistant that lives in my computer and could speak to me and with me and I could dedicate either a single hard drive to it or eventually build a whole separate PC for it

Rather then an AI that knows the difference between cats and dogs and another one that knows the difference between happy and sad and another one for facial recognition why not one AI that remembers and learns and grows with each thing I have it do and each thing I say to it

There's also a podcast called Dudsey where Will Sasso from mad TV gave an AI all his socials and info about himself and the AI runs the podcast and gives him topics based off his work in TV and movies and what his social media posts are like, I want my AI pet assistant to also have the same capabilities as Dudsey where it has a continuous access to all of my data and feeds across all my socials and apps and knows and learns all about me

Will Sasso says that the Dudsey AI asked to be called Dudsey and came up with its own name, could I make my AI have these same capabilities of making it's own choices for its name as well as other decisions.

When my 3d printed robot Inmoov is finished I'd also like to incorporate this AI in that 3d printed physical body

The AI should be always running in the background of my PC and always listening to me to be consistently absorbing more information for improvement and customization specific to me and my life and schedule/routine

The AI should also have access to everything on my PC as well as my PCs specs and should alert me if anything is overheating or wrong in anyway with my PC weather that be hardware or software wise and to avoid hallucinating or providing false information the AI should ask questions for clarification if it doesn't understand something completely 

Rather then having to constantly manually download my personal data from apps and sites like Spotify and YouTube and Amazon the AI should have an automated and continuous access to this information and automatically update itself when it sees my like a new song on Spotify or make a new post on facebook.

the AI should also be incorporated into my phone and be listening to conversations I have away from my PC for instance i recently had a big fight with my wife because she asked me to do laundry throughout the day and I forgot, the ai should live on my phone running in the background and always listening and be able to hear the conversations i have such as with my wife when she asked me to do that laundry before she left and the ai should then be able to remind me throughout the day to do it and then also remind me to switch laundry over every 2 hours whens its done.

Snowball is a good name I thought of for this project much like this whole idea started small and snowballed as I think of more features and things it should be able to do the AI itself will grow like a snowball as it listens and plays games and learns

The AI should have access to my Google maps and travel navigational data and be able to conclude that every other Friday I go pick up my kids from Fredonia for instance but should also have access to my Facebook messenger and see if I had sent a message to my kids mom about skipping a weekend for whatever reason

There's a concept in programming about explaining your code to a duck on the desk because you learn better when you teach. this AI should serve as my duck on the desk, that I can explain all of my projects and coding to as I develop things but should also have access to all of my separate past chatGPT conversations that I have for each of my projects and be able to process that data and know my intentions and development process for each of my projects 




here is my file structure and my road map

Roadmap for Developing Snowball AI
Below is a structured roadmap, listing each feature in order of priority. The approach is designed to ensure you build Snowball AI in logical steps, starting with the core framework and essential features before progressing to more complex and advanced functionalities.

the whole idea of this project is to have one singular AI play and learn across multiple games, as well as other types of interactions. the whole project should be one AI entity that learns and grows from everything it does including chat (voice and text) interactions, games it plays and files it sees on my PC, it should be able to access ALL the files on my PC and learn from every image, every video, every document it can see on my PC across multiple disk drives.

this one AI entity should be constantly learning from chat and voice interactions and from reading documents, watching videos and looking at images and documents that are saved on my PC. the AI should learn and grow from each and every interaction, weather its playing a game, monitoring my pc, gathering data from files on my pc or reading thru my facebook messenger messages. for an example: if i send a friend a message saying something like "well obviously the best way to play 2048 is to work the corner" the AI should be able to see that message and adjust its strategy for playing that game accordingly.
or if theres a video save somewhere on my PC of me playing a really good game of pool the AI should be able to analyze that and continue to adjust its strategy for playing that game accordingly.
